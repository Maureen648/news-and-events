   <h1>Miracle baby celebrates first <br> birthday after being born with <br>major heart defects</h1> 
   <p>
    A MIRACLE tot who spent half of his life in hospital due to major heart defects has <br>defied the odds to reach his first birthday. 
    Little Braydon Boyland celebrated the momentous milestone <br>with his family on Monday after a gruelling year of surgeries and check-ups. 
He was born with three heart defects and doctors had warned there was a one in four chance he would not survive his first surgery.
The tot, from Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, has already undergone two major operations and spent most of his young life, including his first Christmas, in hospital.

   </p>
    
    <p>
        During pregnancy Ms MacFarlane developed pre-eclampsia, which induced early labour and can be life-threatening.
        She was rushed to hospital and baby Braydon was born six weeks early on July 4 2015 weighing a tiny four pounds and facing a fight to survive because of the heart defects.

He was born suffering from pulmonary artesia, and transposition of the great arteries which can lead to breathing difficulties as the de-oxygenated blood cannot get into the lungs.
He was born suffering from pulmonary artesia, and transposition of the great arteries which can lead to breathing difficulties as the de-oxygenated blood cannot get into the lungs.

Doctors told Ms MacFarlane and Mr Boyland it was extremely rare for a baby to suffer all three defects - with newborns usually having just one of the conditions. The condition was considered so grave that medics asked the couple if they wanted a termination.

Ms MacFarlane said: "We knew immediately that wasn't an option. We couldn't have lived with ourselves.

"And when you look at him now today I couldn't imagine life without him."
    </p>
    
    <p>At only eight weeks old Braydon survived open heart surgery to repair the damage. In a second operation the six-month-old baby's body initially rejected a shunt in his heart, so doctors had to open up his chest again and flush it out.

        Braydon's chest was left open for four days to reduce the swelling. And he still faces another life-saving operation before his fifth birthday and may even need a heart transplant when he's older.
        
        In September little Braydon was finally allowed home - only to be rushed back to hospital three days later when he began fighting for breath.
        
        Ms MacFarlane, a stay-at-home mum, said: "We were in Tesco and he turned blue and unresponsive.
        
        "He was rushed back to hospital and was put on a ventilator so he could get a CT scan.
        
        "A few weeks later they tried to put a catheter into a blood vessel in his groin up to his heart but the artery had closed over, so that wasn't possible.

     <p>"He had lost the use of his left lung. I don't quite know how we have coped but you just have to get on with it and take every day as it comes. <br>

        "I think your instincts just kick in. I had never heard of the heart defects before and now I know everything." <br>
        
        Two days before his first Christmas, Braydon underwent a second operation to install a left-sided shunt. <br>
        
        Ms MacFarlane said: "The second surgery was harder as Braydon was a bit more aware. Ross took him in to get the anaesthetic to put him sleep - I couldn't do it.
        
        "He went on a ventilator on December 23 and came off on December 27 and he was allowed home on January 3.
        
        "It was amazing to get him home but also terrifying in case anything else happened. He's been in hospital most of his life so far."</p>
        
        <p>Looking to the future the dedicated couple have been told by doctors that Braydon will never be as fit and healthy as other children but they are determined to give him the best quality of life.

            And sitting up, playing with his birthday balloons, the tot looks like any normal baby celebrating his first birthday.
            
            Ms MacFarlane said: "He's very interactive - he's sitting up on his own and wanting to walk.</p>
            <h2>Atrium’s health hospital has forgiven the medical debts <br>of over 11,500 people, amounting to over $10 million</h2>
            <p>Less than a week after NBC News detailed how the hospital system Atrium <br>Health of North Carolina aggressively pursued former patients’ medical debts, <br>placing liens on their homes to collect on hospital bills, the nonprofit company <br>announced it would cancel those obligations and forgive the unpaid debts <br> associated with them. Some 11,500 liens on people's homes in North Carolina <br>and five other states will be released, Atrium’s parent company, Advocate <br>Health, said with some dating back 20 years or more. <br>
             <br>
                Advocate Health said it is changing its policy now as “the next logical step” following a 2022 decision to stop filing lawsuits and property liens to collect on patients’ medical debts. The company declined NBC News’ request for an interview about the shift.
                
                Reporting on the nationwide problem of medical debt last week, NBC News focused on Terry Belk, 68, a Charlotte resident whose wife died of breast cancer in 2012 and who was himself later diagnosed with prostate cancer. Both his wife’s treatment and Belk’s own racked up tens of thousands of dollars in bills their insurance did not cover. When Belk could not afford to pay them, Atrium Health pursued him in court, the company confirmed. In 2005, Belk signed what’s called a deed of trust with Atrium, granting it the right to receive $23,000 when he sold his family home.
                Belk said he was stunned to receive a phone call from an Atrium Health executive Tuesday advising him that his debts would be forgiven. “There’s no way this would have happened without national coverage by NBC News,” Belk said.

                Rebecca Cerese, health policy advocate at North Carolina Justice Center, a nonprofit fighting poverty in the state, said she was very pleasantly surprised by Atrium’s move and hopes other hospitals will follow suit. “I’m really thankful that folks like Terry have had the courage to speak out about something that is difficult to speak out on,” Cerese told NBC News. “Dealing with an illness or loss of a loved one is hard enough — we should not be compounding that with this additional stress of facing financial ruin.”
                Americans owe some $220 billion in medical debt, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research, polling and news organization. The top three states for medical debt are South Dakota, where 18% of the population is affected, followed by Mississippi at 15% and Belk’s home state of North Carolina at 13%, KFF says.

                From January 2017 through June 2022, North Carolina hospitals sued 7,517 patients and their family members to collect medical debt, according to a study by Duke University School of Law faculty and North Carolina’s Office of State Treasurer. Many of the legal actions resulted in default judgments in state district courts; interest charges and other added fees accounted for an astounding 35% of the $57.3 million in total judgments owed by patients.

                <br>In July, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, announced a medical debt relief program that all of the state’s 99 eligible hospitals agreed to participate in, forgiving medical debts dating back to Jan. 1, 2014, for Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, medical debt considered uncollectible for patients whose income is at or below at least 350% of the federal poverty level will be relieved under the program, as will past medical debt exceeding 5% of a person’s annual income. Nine Atrium hospitals in the state are among the participants.

But that program did not help many former patients carrying medical debt from prior years. For instance, Belk said his debt was excluded from the governor’s initiative.

Announcing its new lien release program, Advocate Health said it would start with the oldest cases first, resolving them individually “over the next several months.” The company warned that the process would take time as it coordinates with courts in each jurisdiction.

When NBC News contacted Atrium Health previously about Belk’s situation, the company spokesman provided a statement saying that the health system has used litigation against patients “as a last resort,” and that Belk signed both the deed of trust and the other judgment voluntarily, “and presumably on the advice of his attorney.”

The company statement added: “As the leading, nonprofit health system in the Southeast, Atrium Health works to ensure access to high-quality care for everyone in each community we’re privileged to serve. For us, there are no profits — just outcomes, in the form of improving health, elevating hope and advancing healing — for all.”

            <h3>American Health Care Faces a Staffing Crisis <br> And It’s Affecting Care</h3>
            <p>Hospitals, urgent care facilities, clinics, and imaging centers throughout the United States are experiencing staffing issues. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, costs have reached new highs as institutions are forced to staff their facilities with temporary health professionals due to rising turnover, fluctuations in demand, and evolving appreciations for work-life balance. These temporary, or “locums,” physicians, mid-level administrators, travel nurses, therapists, and technicians are paid many multiples more than regular staff. Frequently, existing long-term employees feel undervalued in relation to these temporary workers and some resign to join the rapidly expanding pool of locums healthcare workers while others seek out early retirement.

                This burgeoning crisis has greatly affected the bottom line of healthcare facilities, with many of the country’s leading hospital centers posting massive losses. Institutions were already operating at the margins prior to 2020, but the pandemic only increased demands from facilities while also producing skyrocketing expenses. Even more detrimental to the public is the closing of smaller hospitals and community-based clinics, especially in rural and underserved areas. These centers had even less financial buffer to survive through financial hardship. This trend has created health care deserts, significantly impacting maternal care and emergency medicine, among other critical areas of patient care.
                This staffing crisis is leading to ongoing delays related to boarding in emergency departments, prolonged admission to hospitals, and delayed elective and emergent surgeries. Each of these contributes to adverse outcomes, morbidity, and mortality. Accordingly, quality of care is affected. Over the last few years, there has been a rise in medical errors. The Joint Commission, a major agency that monitors hospitals and health facilities, reported a 19% rise in adverse events in 2022. After several decades of creating a safety culture in health care, this is a chilling statistic. Staffing with temporary workers may play a significant and expanding role in this negative trend. Logically, temporary workers may lack an intrinsic team dynamic or familiarity with institutional resources and quality assurance practices, allowing mistakes to fall through the cracks. Several decades of developing team-based approaches, where roles are clearly defined and providers are familiar with protocols and optimal approaches for specific disease entities, are now at threat. Moreover, burnout is known to increase medical errors, and the pandemic has only worsened provider well-being via increased time at work and emotional stress.

                <br>Health care administrators were ill-prepared to deal with a lack of full-time staff and have yet to find a solution, even though we are three years removed from the pandemic’s onset. Each spring, new graduates from professional programs typically join hospitals. This is not the case post-pandemic, as many health professionals now join staffing agencies which provide various institutions with contract-based temporary work. New staff receive financial rewards of increased pay, flexibility that improves work-life balance, and many other perks such as housing and travel support. We have watched as health care consultants try to encourage facilities to answer staffing needs with colorful posters, virtual nursing tools, gig economy processes, and other ideas. These may work in other industries, but health care requires special considerations as facilities lack the same profitability and providers face risks from direct patient contact. So how can the healthcare leaders address staffing issues and provide excellent care? We propose several simple ideas that require no consultants and are based on common sense.

Raise salaries by ten to twenty percent. Inflation has decayed the value of earned dollars over the last few years. In particular, physicians earn significantly less than they did earlier this century when adjusted for inflation. Similarly, nurses feel that their salaries have not kept up with their rising educational demands and work hour requirements. Resident physicians at several hospitals have considered unionization to combat the rising time demands, subpar benefits and parental leave protections, and inadequate financial compensation. When equated for hours worked, resident physicians, who have completed over eight years of higher education, earn under $25 per hour and often struggle to make ends meet. Employees are less likely to leave a facility and more likely to improve the quality of their work if they feel valued by the management. Why reward locums with several multiples of hourly wage when you can develop a loyal workforce?

Provide in-house 24/7 child care staff. Many individuals entering health care are young individuals who may be starting families. Yet many providers are forced to work well over 40 hours per week. Quality child care is a great perk, both financially and emotionally for staff. Staff will appreciate onsite care that is safe for their children. It also has the benefit that parents can visit children during breaks. This easy cost-effective idea will be a major recruitment magnet and retention tool which can concurrently fight burnout.
